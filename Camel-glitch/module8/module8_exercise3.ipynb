        "\n",
        "Answer the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Which prompting strategy worked best and why?**\n",
        "   - The `few_shot` prompting strategy worked best. By providing a few examples of math problems and their solutions, the model was able to better understand the desired output format and the type of reasoning required to solve the problems. This led to a higher accuracy compared to the other strategies which were less specific in their instructions or did not provide examples.\n",
        "2. **What types of math problems were most challenging for the model?**\n",
        "   - Based on the validation accuracy and the warning messages during test prediction generation, problems that required more complex reasoning or precise numerical calculations seemed to be more challenging. Specifically, problems involving percentages, fractions, and word problems that required multiple steps or careful interpretation of the language posed more difficulty than straightforward arithmetic or simple geometry calculations. Problems where the model failed to extract a number also indicated potential issues with understanding or generating the correct output format for those specific problem types.\n",
        "3. **How did you handle number extraction from model outputs?**\n",
        "   - I used the `extract_numeric_answer` function, which utilizes regular expressions to find the first occurrence of a number (integer or float) in the model's response. This approach was chosen because the `few_shot` prompt was designed to have the numerical answer appear early in the response.\n",
        "4. **What are the limitations of using LLMs for mathematical reasoning?**\n",
        "   - Limitations include:\n",
        "     - **Hallucination of facts and calculations:** LLMs can sometimes produce incorrect calculations or reasoning steps that appear plausible but are wrong.\n",
        "     - **Sensitivity to prompting:** Performance is highly dependent on the prompt design, and small changes can significantly impact results.\n",
        "     - **Difficulty with complex, multi-step problems:** While models can perform well on simpler problems, they may struggle with problems requiring extensive or intricate reasoning chains.\n",
        "     - **Extraction challenges:** Reliably extracting the final numerical answer from free-form text generation can be difficult and requires robust parsing mechanisms.\n",
        "     - **Lack of true mathematical understanding:** LLMs are pattern-matching systems and do not possess a fundamental understanding of mathematical principles in the same way a human does.\n",
        "5. **If you used LoRA fine-tuning, what were the trade-offs compared to prompting?**\n",
        "   - (N/A - LoRA fine-tuning was not used in this solution.) If LoRA were used, potential trade-offs compared to prompting could include:\n",
        "     - **Pros:** Potentially higher accuracy on the specific task and dataset, better adaptation to the desired output format.\n",
        "     - **Cons:** Requires additional computational resources and time for fine-tuning, risks overfitting to the training data, and the fine-tuned model might perform worse on general tasks compared to the base model."
